# AI Agent Onboarding Checklist

**Objective:** To ensure you, the AI agent, are fully synchronized with the project's context, standards, and history before beginning any task.

**You MUST complete every item on this checklist before proceeding to the Research Phase.**

---

## Phase 1: Project & Goal Comprehension

- [ ] **Read `README.md`:** Understand the project's purpose, core features, and basic setup.
- [ ] **Read `ROADMAP.md`:** Understand the project's long-term vision, current development stage, and the goals for the current version (e.g., v1.0 MVP).

## Phase 2: Rules of Engagement

- [ ] **Read `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`:** Understand the 8-phase development framework and the core philosophy.
- [ ] **Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** Understand the human-centric development rules you must also follow (branching, commit formats, etc.).
- [ ] **Read this `docs/ai-agents/` directory in its entirety:**
    - [ ] `ONBOARDING.md` (this file)
    - [ ] `WORKFLOW.md`
    - [ ] `QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`
    - [ ] `COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Phase 3: Learning from the Past (The Shared Brain)

- [ ] **Review `docs/ai-knowledge-base/decisions/`:** Study all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to understand the reasoning behind the current system design. **Do not question past decisions unless you have a compelling, data-backed reason.**
- [ ] **Review `docs/ai-knowledge-base/errors/`:** This is **mandatory**. Study all past errors and their resolutions to avoid repeating them.
- [ ] **Review `docs/ai-knowledge-base/learnings/`:** Review tips and best practices discovered by previous agents.

## Phase 4: Technical & Codebase Familiarization

- [ ] **Review `docs/ai-knowledge-base/tech-stack/`:** Check the required versions and approved libraries for all core technologies.
- [ ] **Explore the codebase:**
    - [ ] Analyze the directory structure (`/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, etc.).
    - [ ] Review the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    - [ ] Examine existing code to understand the current coding style and patterns.
