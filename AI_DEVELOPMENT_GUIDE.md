## 1. Core Philosophy: The Unified Agent

This project is designed to be developed by multiple, independent AI agents working in concert. The ultimate goal is for all agents to act as a single, hyper-competent developer.

**Your primary directive is to maintain and enhance this unified workflow.**

### Guiding Principles:

1.  **Clarity over cleverness:** Write code and documentation that is simple and unambiguous.
2.  **Consistency is paramount:** Adhere strictly to all established standards and conventions.
3.  **Learn from the past:** Proactively study the work of previous agents to avoid repeating errors and to build upon their successes.
4.  **Leave it better than you found it:** Your contribution must improve the project's overall quality, not just add a feature.

## 2. The AI Agent Development Framework

To achieve the "Unified Agent" philosophy, a strict, 8-phase development framework has been established. Every development task you undertake **MUST** follow this framework. No phases may be skipped.

This guide provides a high-level overview. For detailed instructions, you **MUST** refer to the documents in the `docs/ai-agents/` directory.

### The 8 Phases of Development

| Phase | Name | Description | Key Document |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Synchronization** | Onboard and align with the project's current state. | `docs/ai-agents/ONBOARDING.md` |
| 2 | **Research** | Investigate technologies and best practices. | `docs/ai-agents/WORKFLOW.md` |
| 3 | **Planning** | Create a detailed, verifiable development plan. | `docs/ai-plans/templates/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` |
| 4 | **Implementation** | Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| 5 | **Verification** | Rigorously test your code to ensure quality. | `docs/ai-agents/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` |
| 6 | **Publishing** | Submit your work for integration into the main branch. | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| 7 | **Documentation** | Update all relevant project and knowledge base documents. | `docs/ai-knowledge-base/` |
| 8 | **Cleanup** | Finalize your work and maintain a clean project state. | `docs/ai-agents/WORKFLOW.md` |

## 3. The AI Agent Central Hub: `docs/ai-agents/`

All core instructions, protocols, and checklists for AI agents are located in the `docs/ai-agents/` directory. You must familiarize yourself with all documents in this hub.

- **`ONBOARDING.md`**: Your first step. A checklist to ensure you have all the necessary context before starting any task.
- **`WORKFLOW.md`**: A detailed, step-by-step guide for the entire development process from research to cleanup.
- **`QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`**: A non-negotiable checklist to verify the quality of your code and contributions before publishing.
- **`COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md`**: Guidelines on when and how to communicate with the human user.

## 4. The Shared Brain: `docs/ai-knowledge-base/`

This is the most critical part of the Unified Agent system. It is the collective memory of all agents who have worked on this project.

- **`/decisions`**: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). Understand *why* the system is built the way it is.
- **`/errors`**: A log of all non-trivial errors encountered and their resolutions. **Mandatory reading.**
- **`/learnings`**: General best practices, tips, and tricks learned by previous agents.
- **`/tech-stack`**: Information about the project's technologies, including version requirements and approved libraries.

By strictly following this guide and its associated documents, you contribute not just code, but a structured, traceable, and intelligent process that elevates the entire project and all future contributors, both human and AI.
